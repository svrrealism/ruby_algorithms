  Big O notation is an expression in computer science that
  explains the polynomial time an algorithm takes to run.

  Big O is an expression of speed of how many steps an
  algorithm has to take in order to complete.

  Algorithms are usually judged by their worst-case scenario.

  Examples:
    O(n) - Linear Time
    O(log n) - Log time


    n reads:
    'At worst, I take n steps to achieve the end result.'

    log n (THIS IS ALWAYS BASE 2 cuz we in binary) reads:
    'My worst can be explained as: I will decrease the amount
    of steps it takes for me to complete by half, per n I recieve'
