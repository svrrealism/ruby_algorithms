QUICKSORT - elegant sorting algorithm that's used in practice.

New skill to apply to problems; a recursive technique called:

  DIVIDE AND CONQUER (D&C)



First thing we should asked when 'stumped' is...

---> 'can I use divide and conquer?'

Quicksort is much faster than selection sort


Three examples of Divide and Conquer:

1). Suppose you are a farmer with some land.


PROBLEM: You want to:
        1). Divide this land into even, square plots,
        2). They should be as big as possible.

TRANSLATED QUESTION: What is the maximum of amount of even square plots of the
                     largest size that can be created from an input of an originating
                     land plot size of: 1680 width * 640 height ?

PROBLEM VISUALLY:


Land plot given:

        1680 meters
***************************
***************************
*************************** 640 meters
